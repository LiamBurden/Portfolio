                "Say Goodbye" follows Oola a small star person as everyone in the village slowly leave and the village becomes less maintained.
                My main inspiration was having just left university and moving away and how it would have felt to not say goodbye the people that meant so much in that time.

               A fun thing I learnt during this project was with vertex displacement in materials which allowed me to 
               create a cylindrical world effect like in "Animal Crossing" games. This effect is made by passing the camara's Z position 
               into the material and then the further away it it the lower the vertex is displaced to.
