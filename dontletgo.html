                [Don’t] Let Go is an action-adventure game centring around the players relationship with a mysterious cube. 
                Together the unlikely duo must escape an abandoned city hidden deep within a crater, 
                solving its many enigmas and avoiding ancient omnipotent threats.

               This was my final major project at University, I worked alongside 2 designers and 1 other programmer. 
               My primary role was to developer the player, cube and camera systems. 
               I also made all of the games shaders to help create the aesthetic that we wanted as a team. 
               On top of this I also worked on the game manager which managing the scene loading and as well as saving and loading a file.

                    I also made the sav and load system allowing in world events such as a tower collapsing to persist between play sessions, 
                    to immerse players more in the gameplay experience. 
                    As a part of this system I encrypt and decrypt the save file using the Vigenère cipher where the key is an image file. 
                    This was done to ensure players cannot easily modify their save file to cheat or ruin their experience.
